developing an open-source multiplayer voxel game using Godot 4.3. This project aims to offer a unique experience by incorporating portals that connect to worlds or servers created by other players, all integrated into a single game ecosystem. Items will be transferred between these worlds through a custom backend system powered by TheGates. Additionally, the game will have a strong emphasis on combat, similar to Rust.

You will build empires and defend them from enemies, from other players to monsters
